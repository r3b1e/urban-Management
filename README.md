# 🌍 Smart Circular Cities – AI-Powered Waste, Energy & Flood Management  

## 📌 Description  
Smart Circular Cities is an **AI-driven web application** that integrates **waste management, solar energy tracking, and flood monitoring** to create a **sustainable and resilient urban ecosystem**. The platform leverages **machine learning, real-time data, and IoT-based tracking** to optimize city resources, encourage responsible waste disposal, and provide early disaster warnings.

## 🚨 Problem Statement  
Urban areas face **three critical challenges**:  

1. **Inefficient Waste Management** – Poor segregation, fraudulent disposal, and lack of optimized collection routes lead to pollution.  
2. **Energy Inefficiency** – The potential of **solar energy** remains underutilized, and **EV infrastructure** needs better planning.  
3. **Flood Disasters** – Unpredictable climate conditions result in **flooding, unprepared evacuations, and property damage**.  

Our solution **uses AI to predict, prevent, and optimize** these urban challenges, making cities **cleaner, greener, and safer**.
